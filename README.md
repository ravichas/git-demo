# git-demo

This repository is a **teaching sandbox** used to demonstrate core Git and GitHub workflows in class.

It is intentionally minimal and is **not tied to any specific course** (Bioinformatics, Data Science, ML, etc.).

## What this repo is used for

This repo is used to demonstrate:

- Cloning a GitHub repository
- Creating directories and files inside a repo
- Adding, committing, and pushing changes
- Copying a project directory from Google Drive into a GitHub repo
- Using Git from Google Colab or a local machine

## Important clarification (common confusion)

> You **cannot clone a directory into GitHub**.

You can:
- **Clone a repository** *from* GitHub to your machine or Colab
- **Add a directory** to a repository by committing and pushing files

Git tracks **files**, not empty directories.
